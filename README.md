# Webform that updates DB

Assumes a pre-existing REST API & running Postgres DB

I had an existing project [crud-app](https://github.com/aaronhmiller/crud-app) that has an Express-based CRUD API that uses Postgres.

I asked ChatGPT:

1. `write me a web page that interacts with a REST API backend that uses Postgres DB`
2. `now show me how to create a web form that allows me to edit the data using the REST API`

It told me to install Flask (Python framework) and gave me app.py & index.html & style.css for a webform that interacted with my Postgres DB using my REST API.
